      "Mario is depicted as a portly plumber who lives in the fictional land of the Mushroom Kingdom with Luigi, his younger, taller brother.[3][47][48] In the television series and film, Mario and Luigi are originally from Brooklyn, New York.[47] Little is known of Mario's childhood, though the infant version of Mario, Baby Mario, first appeared in 1995 in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, and has often appeared in Nintendo sports games since then. Baby Mario has a major role along with Baby Luigi in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time and appears in Yoshi's Island DS"

      "Mario's occupation is plumbing, though in the original Donkey Kong games he is a carpenter.[61] Mario has had several other occupations: in the Dr. Mario series of puzzle games, which debuted in 1990,[39] Mario is portrayed as a medical physician named "Dr. Mario";[62] in the Game Boy game Mario's Picross, Mario is an archaeologist; and in Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis, Mario is the president of a profitable toy-making company.[63] Mario is an athlete in Mario sports games including Mario Sports Mix, Mario Strikers Charged, and Mario Tennis Aces; as well as a kart racer in the Mario Kart series."
